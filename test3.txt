### **Computer Security Overview**
- **Definition**: Protection of computer systems and data from harm, theft, and unauthorized use.
- **Security Goals**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Protects data from unauthorized disclosure.
  - **Integrity**: Ensures data hasn't been altered.
  - **Availability**: Ensures authorized users have timely access to data.

### **Confidentiality Tools**
- **Encryption**: Transforms information using a key, ensuring only those with the decryption key can access it.
- **Access Control**: Rules/policies restricting access to sensitive data.
- **Authentication**: Verifies identity using:
  - Something you have (e.g., ID card).
  - Something you know (e.g., password).
  - Something you are (e.g., fingerprint).
- **Authorization**: Verifies if a user/system is allowed to access resources.
- **Physical Security**: Barriers like locks, secure rooms, etc.

### **Integrity Tools**
- **Backups**: Regular archiving of data.
- **Checksums**: Maps data to a numerical value to detect alterations.
- **Data Correcting Codes**: Detect and correct data changes through redundancy.

---

### **Availability Tools**
- **Physical Protections**: Infrastructure that keeps information accessible.
- **Computational Redundancies**: Backup systems in case of failures.

### **Threats & Attacks**
Eavesdropping**: Unauthorized interception of communication.
Alteration**: Modifying data (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks).
Denial-of-Service (DoS)**: Overloading a service, making it unavailable.
Masquerading**: Faking identity in communications.
Repudiation**: Denying receipt or commitment to data.
Correlation and Traceback**: Tracing the source of information.

*The Ten Security Principles**
Economy of Mechanism**: Keep security systems simple.
Fail-Safe Defaults**: Default settings should deny access.
Complete Mediation**: Every access to a resource must be checked.
Open Design**: Security design should be public, relying only on secret keys.
Separation of Privilege**: Multiple conditions should be needed for access.
Least Privilege**: Users should have minimal access needed.
Least Common Mechanism**: Minimize shared access to resources.
Psychological Acceptability**: User-friendly security settings.
Work Factor**: Make security breaches costly in time/resources.
*Compromise Recording**: Recording intrusions can be more practical than prevention.

Access Control Models
Access Control Matrices**: Defines subject-object access permissions in a table format.
Access Control Lists (ACL)**: Lists permissions for each object, useful for file systems.
Capabilities**: Lists permissions for each subject.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Defines access rights for roles rather than individuals.
